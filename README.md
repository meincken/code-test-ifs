## ðŸš€ Quick start

    ```shell
    cd ifs-site/
    npm install
    npm run develop
    ```

I have built the basic structure of what I would do as an example.
This is not production ready code, more a draft of a layout that could be used,
and contains very basic UI features but as you can imagine this will
still need more work to be fully production ready.

I have not completed any unit testing or added any pipelines and full optimisation
will come at a later date. It is using Gatsby, but I have left out a few things
like SVG Support.
